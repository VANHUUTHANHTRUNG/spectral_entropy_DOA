# spectral_entropy_DOA

For theorerical background, check the original paper in `spectral_entropy_DOA.pdf`.
The MATLAB code implementation includes:
  - `analysis.m` and `analysis.mlx` for the use of `spectral_entropy.m` in context of EEG signal analysing.
  - `spectral_entropy.m` contains the computation of spectral entropy from PSD.
  - `spectral_eeg.m` is a wrapper that provides the necessary data for the spectral entropy computing.
The final report was exported to be `spectral_entropy_analysis_report.pdf`.
The used data was saved in the `case_1.mat` file.
Walkthrough the `requirement.pdf` and `support_doc.pdf` for more information.
